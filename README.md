# Literature on Graph Neural Networks of Biological Molecules

A reading list for deep graph learning acceleration, including but not limited to related research on software and hardware level. The list covers related papers, conferences, tools, books, blogs, courses and other resources. We have a [team of Maintaners](#Maintainers) responsible for maintainance, meanwhile also welcome contributions from anyone.

Literatures in this page are arranged from a classification perspective, including the following topics:
- [Literature on Graph Neural Networks Acceleration](#literature-on-graph-neural-networks-acceleration)
  - [Hardware Acceleration for Graph Neural Networks](#hardware-acceleration-for-graph-neural-networks)
  - [System Designs for Deep Graph Learning](#system-designs-for-deep-graph-learning)
  - [Algorithmic Acceleration for Graph Neural Networks](#algorithmic-acceleration-for-graph-neural-networks)
  - [Surveys and Performance Analysis on Graph Learning](#surveys-and-performance-analysis-on-graph-learning)
  - [Maintainers](#maintainers)
